                  Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions
                  that cause cardiovascular disease (CVD). According to World Health Organization (2021),
                  cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders of the
                  heart and blood vessels and includes coronary heart disease,
                  cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions.

                  HEART DISEASE FACTS
                </h2>
                <p className="text-muted">
                  More than four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths
                  are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths
                  occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age (WHO, 2021).
                  It is widely discovered that cardiovascular deaths occur mostly
                  in low-income or minimal economy countries due to the fact
                  it resources and awareness cannot be pushed to contain it or
                  to incur preventive measures through the health sector,
                  as the standard of living is so low.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted">
                  In fact, a study few years ago looked at the symptoms
                  most often seen in women who had experienced a heart attack.
                  The number of people suffering from heart disease is on the rise.
                  The report from the world health organization (WHO) shows us a
                  large number of people die every year due to heart disease
                  all over the world. Heart disease is also stated to be a
                  great life taker amongst different races especially the Americans.

                  Over the past decade, we've learned a great deal
                  about what causes heart attacks and how to prevent them.
                  But unless you follow medical news closely,
                  there's a chance you might have misconceptions
                  about the risk factors for heart disease, or heart disease itself.
                  Here are 10 commonly held but mistaken beliefs.
                  Replacing these myths with truths will give you
                  the information you need so you and your doctor
                  can plan the best path to a healthy heart.
